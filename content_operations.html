                    <li>You possess excellent written and verbal communication skills in the English language. If you happen to be fluent in other languages, it is a big plus - you will likely meet someone in the team to practice your other language with!

                    <li>Your mindset is process-driven and nothing feels more delightful to you than an assembly line of words and sentences S2
                    <li>You work independently and are always on top of your tasks and responsibilities - being micromanaged annoys you to the bone.
                </ul>
